# A Web Application for The School of Computing Science Exam Boards

### Overview
For my individual masters project, I built a full stack web application for Glasgow University School of Computing Science to manage student grades and calculate degree classifications in preparation for external validation. The university needed a new system because the current one was antiquated to the point that it was unusable by many staff members. I was asked to create a web application that encapsulated all of the original functionality but had a much better user experience. 

For the project I taught myself React for the front end which I found challenging but rewarding when I saw the final product. I also enjoyed interviewing users for requirements which allowed me to meet and develop a relationship with lecturers and staff members of the department that I was studying in. All users in my final evaluation survey thought that the app was a significant improvement from the original.

### Technologies Used
