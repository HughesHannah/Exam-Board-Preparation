# A Web Application for Glasgow University's School of Computing Science

### Overview
As part of my individual master's project, I designed and developed a full-stack web application for Glasgow University's School of Computing Science. The aim was to enhance their existing system and provide a better user experience for managing student grades and calculating degree classifications, in preparation for external validation. The university recognised the need for an updated system as the current one was antiquated and unsuitable for many staff members. The resulting application encapsulated all the original functionality, but with a modern and user-friendly interface.

During the project, I taught myself React for the frontend, a challenging yet rewarding experience that resulted in a final product that was praised by all users in my evaluation survey. My work also involved conducting interviews with lecturers and staff members of the department to gather requirements and build strong relationships.

### Technologies Used
* Frontend - React, MaterialUI, Recharts
